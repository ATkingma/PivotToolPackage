The spelling appears to be correct. However, there are some grammar and punctuation errors that could be corrected for clarity and readability. Here's a revised version:

a. Hold your mouse on the top left window tab.
b. Open the pivot tool tab.
c. Select a game object with a mesh filter.
d. Follow step 3.
e. Follow step 4.

ABOUT
This tool helps you change the pivot point of an object without having to create an empty parent object as the pivot point. There is one way of adjusting the pivot:
a. If the object has a mesh filter, then the script first creates an instance of the mesh, adjusts the mesh's pivot point by altering its vertices, normals, and tangents, and finally changes the position of the currently selected game object.

HOW TO SET THE PIVOT (THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO SET THE PIVOT POINT):
A. To change an object's pivot point, enable the tool with the button "Enable Gizmo" or the button "/", and move the handle to the desired pivot position. Then, press the "Set New Pivot" button, and the pivot will be set.

B. You can also move the pivot at the Move Pivot tab. Here are some sliders that can be moved in the x, y, z directions. You can change the value of the slider scale at the Settings tab. Then, if you have your new pivot position, you can press the "Set Pivot Position" button.

C. You can use the center button to center the pivot at the center of the currently selected mesh. Then, set the pivot with the "Set Pivot" button.

D. There is a last feature that is multiple pivot tool. This uses more than 2 GUI handles, and the center of the amount of GUI handles will be calculated. If you have the desired position, you can press the "Set Pivot Position" button.

EXPORTING
You can export the mesh as the following file types:
Asset (.asset)
FBX (.fbx)
OBJ (.obj)
STL (.stl)

ROTATION(NEW FEATURE!)
There is a new feature available that enables you to rotate the pivot. To access this feature, use the Gizmo located in the "PivotTool" tab on the main page. Once there, activate the rotation function using the designated button. Please note that this button only appears when you have also enabled the Gizmo. Additionally, you can adjust the rotation further in the "Utilities" tab.

SUGGESTIONS
I've got some future plans for the tool, but I need more time for this. If you have some suggestions, you can email me at the email at the top of the text.
For the future:
